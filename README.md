# Coursera Data Science Specialization course 3 project
This file describes how run_analysis.R works.
* Download the zip file to the ***same folder as the run_analysis.R script*** and unzip it.
* Rename the folder with *PRAData*
* Run the script in RStudio using *source("run_analysis.R")*
* Two *.csv* files are generated by the R script:
  * *merged_data.csv* containing the merged dataset from the training and test data.
  * *averaged_data* containing a data frame of averaged variables grouped by *subject* and *activity*

Many thanks for your review.
